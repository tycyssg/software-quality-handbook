### Task estimation in Scrum environment

&nbsp;

## Benefits & Challenges Task Estimation :

    ### **Benefits**

        The advantages that can be leveraged through task estimation can laid out as follows :
        1. Allows an insight into the uncertainty of a project
        2. Allows the team to rejudge the project as they understand the project as time progresses reducing uncertainty
        3. Estimates become more reliable which leads to a better deliverable and relationships strengthen between all parts
        4. Estimation supports the decision makers by providing insight the worst and time frame of the project

&nbsp;

### **Challenges**

Even though, as discussed in the preceding points, task estimation is useful in project planning. These are some of the difficulties that people who are in control of task estimation face : 1. Nuance between estimates and commitments. 2. Features are not prioritised and there is no structure in how they are built out. 3. The ambiguity is often ignored. 4. The time frame is often based on the competition of activities over features.

## Taking on the challenges

Using agile planning techniques, we can overcome difficulties in the task estimation phase in scrum. + Work can be done in iterations, this allows a set of requirements to be broken down into features that are finished. Seperaretly planning is done through iterations too.

- Features are prioritised for release, so user stories can be delivered first. Conditions for success at feature and project level are drawn up so that the aims of the iterations are clear.
- Plans are always being updated as the knowledge is gained and so too are the priorities.
- The backlog will not give an estimation for the project.
- Any issue faced should not be picked randomly from the backlog.

## Building out a successful story point estimation

In sizing, the team does an analysis between the different stories for the project. Every story to be sized the following needs to be done, from the PO, developers and Scrum master:

1. Identify stories
2. Discuss the requirements of the story.
3. Take notes for what you want when building the story
4. Find relative sized points for comparison or previous tasks.
5. Conclude as a team about the sizes of the stories.
6. Confirm that your estimates are consistent as the stories progess.
7. Reasses that the indentified stories match the requirements.

| Advantages                                          | Disadvantages                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Greater control over sprint                         | Overheads with no inherit value can affect accuracy of estimate |
| More accurate estimates                             | Hours worked combined with logging hours                        |
| Harder to under or over comit                       | Working In Hours May Lead To Micro-Managing                     |
| Unfinished work is clear to see                     |                                                                 |
| Input is can be giving after the fact and is valued |                                                                 |

## Bad practices of Task Estimation

    + Teams can be interrupted when in production or other responsibilties arise.
    + Teams give estimates with out regard for skill level and experience.
    + Teams sometimes have memebers join and leave and this can affect the productivity.
