### Task estimation in Scrum with Relative Estimation

#### Intro

---

Planning and estimating are essential to developing products and services that fall in line with the product backlog, during the task estimation meetings, time frames are given that are required to complete the given tasks in the task list. The teams involved have their updated task lists and a now comprehensive list of tasks are added to the current sprint. To develop a realistic Estimated task list, the team must include any testing and integration that they must preform in order for the product or service can be added to the list of deliverables from any previous sprints.

During the meetings, the team uses their task list to come up with the estimations of the hours and people needed or any other resources they might need to carry out and finish the tasks within a given sprint or if it will carry over to future sprints, an advantage of this is that is allows the team to have an understanding of where other members of the team are at with regard to user stories and requirements so they have an accurate picture of the effort needed, all this information can be used to consider how long or short a certain sprint can be as they all have a shared perspective and understanding of what is required.

#### Relative Estimation and its' benefits

This is the process of estimating task completion, not in time but rather how items are similar to each other in terms of complexity, an example of this would be "In project A task C is three times harder than task A" it would then be reasonable to say that given it took 4 weeks to complete task A it would take 12 weeks to complete task C. A different way to think about it that you are now looking back at previous tasks and sizing up what the tasks where like, humans are naturally good at this kind of task.

When you are estimating how long a task will take, people usually tend to inflate time estimates, so you are giving slack if something does come up that you need to overcome, and a more accurate time frame is made, and this allows the task to be broken down a lot more effectively and estimate them all.

### Man hours

In most industries man hours is wide spread from retail to the IT industry, it uses an estimation of the work that can be completed by one person in an hour, they have their uses but have their big flaws to them too.

#1) Not all tasks are easy to estimate precisely  
#2) The level of experience is not considered when drawing up the estimations, if a much more junior dev completes a task before the given date the estimation is now invalid

## Why use story points

There is no correlation with skill and experience of the estimator, as mentioned an estimation can become invalid if given to both a Snr or Jnr developer, story points eliminate this problem and are measured across the team.

Speed is tracked as velocity, this is a powerful capacity planning method that demonstrates how much product backlog and much better to handle in one sprint, team members can discuss ways of getting a better velocity which would result in a better and more effective team.

No need to redo the estimation as the velocity is flexible.
