### Task estimation in Scrum
#### Intro
***
Task estimation is a team sport. Everyone (developers, designers, testers, management people) from 
the team has to be involved, it is the key to succeed in one of the difficult aspects of the job.

Usually once every week or two weeks the whole team gather together to start planning the next sprint.
Each sprint has a goal, and to achieve that goal, certain stories has to be created, velocity and burndown
chars has to be analyzed in order to achieve that goal.

#### How it is been done
***
The main part of a sprint are the user stories. Story is divided in tasks and typically is a functionality
that will be visible to end users. It represents something that generally is worked on by more than one person.

Tasks on the other hand, is typically something like "code this", "design that", "create test data for" and so on.
Tasks tend to be things done by one person.

When the estimation starts usually are two outcomes.
1. Story complexity which is something common between all team members.
2. Work hours per Task from the Story, which is an average between the people who work on a specific technology.

When, "work hours" are estimated there are big chances that the estimation is not close to a real scenario.


The main reason is that most of the time developers ignore certain steps from a completed task. A 
task is considered complete when is "delivered", in other words developed, tested, merged and deployed.
When developers estimate they consider only the developing part and sometimes the testing part but they
forget to estimate things like.

+ The task may come back to them for certain fixes.
+ Solving the Git conflicts
+ Unexpected bugs.
+ Integration issues.

The best estimation are given by the QA people. They take into consideration the development time given
by the developers and on top of that they add time for testing and bugs because they are familiar with
this kind of situations and at the end something close to the truth is given.
