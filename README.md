# Coding Standards

Coding standards are collections of rules and guidelines that determine the programming style, procedures, and methods for a programming language.

### Importance of Coding Standards

Without coding standards, every individual in a team will use their own coding styles. 
It will not be easy to maintain and will be difficult to debug the code.

## Formatting

Code formatting allows programmers to vaguely convey what their code intends to do. 
Code formatting is often a programmer's reader's first encounter with their system. 
It deserves attention and care.

### Components That Affect Code Formatting:

* Quick Readability: The reader should be able to understand the gross structure of the code in a glimpse. 
  The shapes made by blocks of text help you communicate the overall structure.

* Detailed Readability: The reader must be able to read lots of code in depth.

* Length: The number of lines must be minimized so that browsers can be as small as possible.

* Width: The width of code must be minimized. Code must not ordinarily spill across the right margin, 
  requiring horizontal scrolling or destroying the shape of the text with line wrapping.

### Essential Parts of Code Formatting

Conventions have been made to make sure code is as understandable as possible. 
This helps avoid errors, troubleshoot problems and makes maintaining someone elseâ€™s (or even your own) work much easier.

There are differing conventions depending on the language that you are using. 
Yet, all of them basically revolve around the following:

1. Indentation 
2. White space
3. Capitalization and naming conventions
4. Style and spelling of functions, variables and more
5. Use and style of comments

## Naming Conventions

 A naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers 
 which represent variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.

### Significance of Naming Conventions

It is important for programmers to utilise and agree on naming conventions instead of allowing everyone
to choose any character sequence.

The following are reasons why: 

* To reduce the effort needed to read and understand source code
* To enable code reviews to focus on more important issues than arguing over syntax and naming standards.
* To enable code quality review tools to focus their reporting mainly on significant issues other than syntax and style preferences.

### Potential Benefits 

Some of the potential benefits that can be obtained include the following:

* to help formalise expectations and encourage consistency within a development team;
* to enable the use of automated refactoring or search and replace tools with minimal potential for error;
* to enhance clarity in cases of potential ambiguity;
* to help avoid "naming collisions" that might occur when the work product of different organisations is combined.
* to provide meaningful data to be used in project handovers which require submission of program source code and all relevant documentation;
* to provide better understanding in case of code reuse after a long interval of time.
